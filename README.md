# Activity2Vec: Learning ADL Embeddings from Sensor Data with a Sequence-to-Sequence Model

In this study, we investigate a method for automatically extracting universal and meaningful features that are applicable across similar time series-based learning tasks such as activity recognition and fall detection. We propose creating a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model to perform this feature learning. Beside avoiding feature engineering, the meaningful features learned by the seq2seq model can also be utilized for semi-supervised learning. We evaluate both of these benefits on datasets collected fromwearable and ambient sensors.
